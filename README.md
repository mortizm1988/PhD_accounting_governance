# How is financial accounting information used to detect and mitigate governance conflicts?

We will review different streams of literature on the role of financial accounting information in corporate governance.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and unified view of how financial accounting items are used to:

(1) define contractual relationships between corporate stakeholders and the firm. 

(2) monitor the fulfillment of the contractual obligations,

(3) to mitigate the conflicts that arise from the contractual relationships.

# Course structure

Chapter 1 starts by explaining formal and informal contracts, followed by accounting choice and disclosure process costs.
