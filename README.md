# Financial Accounting in Corporate Governance: A Contractual View


Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and unified view of how financial accounting items are used to:

(1) define contractual relationships between corporate stakeholders and the firm. 

(2) monitor the fulfillment of the contractual obligations.

We also discuss current research areas.

The course is ideal for economics, finance, or accounting students with basic knowledge of microeconomics and contract theory.

# Course structure

Chapter 1 explains formal and informal contracts. The emphasis is on **accounting choice** and **disclosure processing costs**.

Then, from Chapter 2 to Chapter 6, we will review the literature on how financial accounting information influences governance conflicts with several stakeholders.
